\section{Introduction}

\section{Methods}

The equations of conservation of momentum for a multiple species dust and gas
mixture are given by
%
\begin{align}
   \rho_g \frac{d \vec{v}_g}{dt} &= - \nabla P + \sum_i K_i \left(\vec{v}_{d_i}
                                    - \vec{v}_{g}\right), \\
   \rho_{d_i} \frac{d \vec{v}_{d_i}}{dt} &= - K_i \left(\vec{v}_{d_i}
                                                       - \vec{v}_{g}\right),
\end{align}
%

\section{Numerical tests}

\subsection{Dusty-box}

We performed the multigrain version of the dusty-box test described in
\citet{Laibe:2011}. The dusty-box involves setting up a periodic box of uniform
density gas and dust with an initial differential velocity between the gas and
dust. In this test the equation of motion simplifies to
%
\begin{align}
   \frac{\partial \Delta \vec{V}}{\partial t} = - \Omega_n \Delta \vec{V},
\end{align}
%
where $\Delta \vec{V}$ is the differential velocity vector, and $\Omega_n$ is
the drag matrix given in Eq.~64 of \citet{Laibe:2014}. Dusty-box is a test
of the exchange of momentum between gas and dust species via the drag force. The
original dusty-box test was for a single grain size. We ran the multigrain
version described in \citet{Laibe:2014} in the linear Epstein drag regime
\citep{Epstein:1924}.

For each test we chose five dust species with grain sizes covering two orders of
magnitude---0.1 cm, 0.316 cm, 1.0 cm, 3.16 cm, and 10.0 cm---with equal mass in
each grain size bin. We performed four simulations, varying the total
dust-to-gas ratio: 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0. The gas is initially motionless,
and each dust species has uniform velocity in the positive x-direction.

\begin{figure*}
   \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/delta_vx_Epstein.pdf}
      \caption{Dusty-box numerical test showing the differential velocity
         between the dust and gas. From left to right: the total dust-to-gas
         ratio is 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0. The open circles represent the
         results from the Phantom simulation. The solid and dashed lines
         represent the analytical solution with and without, respectively,
         taking back reaction into account.\label{fig:dustybox-Epstein}}
   \end{center}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:dustybox-Epstein} shows the time evolution of the mean velocity
differential between the gas and each dust species, compared with analytical
solutions. The dashed lines represent the analytical solution without
backreaction from the dust on the gas. The solid lines represent the analytical
solution including backreaction. For low dust-to-gas ratio (0.01) both
analytical solutions give the same decay of differential velocity, with which
the Phantom simulation agrees. For larger dust-to-gas ratios (0.1, 1.0, and
10.0) the analytical solutions diverge, and the Phantom simulation data follows
the backreaction-inclusive solution. For dust-to-gas ratios of 1.0 and 10.0 we
see that the smallest grains (0.1 cm) slow rapidly and reverse direction with
respect to the gas before coming to the barycentric velocity.

\subsection{Dusty-wave}

Same collection of tests as dusty-box.

\subsection{Dusty-shock}
See Benitez-Llambay paper.

\section{Application}

\subsection{Circumbinary disc}

Do a comparison between multiple single grain calculations vs one multigrain
calculation focussing on dust trapping in a circumbinary disc. The figure would
show a phase difference between the dust (or gas) distribution comparing the
single-grain vs multigrain calculation.
